# If PROTEIN_CODES is present, MAX_LENGTH and SAMPLE_SIZE are ignored.
#
# Parameters for the search to fetch the PDB protein codes:
# - MIN_LENGTH is the minimum number of residues that a chain must have.
# - MAX_LENGTH is the maximum number of residues that a chain can have.
# - MIN_RESIDUES is the minimum number of valid residues (i.e., excluding the
# ligands) that the peptide chain must have. The search is based on MIN_LENGTH,
# but some of the fetched proteins may have many ligands. Hence, from each
# chain we discard the ligands and we skip all the chains with less residues
# than MIN_RESIDUES.
# - SAMPLE_SIZE is the number of proteins to include.
